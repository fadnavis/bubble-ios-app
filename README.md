#This is the Bubble Remote iOS app

#This app helps users change TV channels from their iPhones (requires Bubble Uno Device - can be purchased from Amazon India)

# User sees all the currently running and upcoming TV programs across 500 channels on all major DTH operators in India - Tata Sky, Videocon d2h, Airtel, Sun Direct, Dish TV - and can change channels on their TV. Users can also control their TV (all major TV brands supported). Please note that this app consumes APIs built by Bubble Technologies Pvt. Ltd. These APIs are not public and as such, the app will not function without these backend services and the Bubble Uno device.

# The purpose of this repository is not to replicate the entire Bubble product but to share code components such as Bluetooth communication between Bubble Device and Bubble app. Bubble Uno is built on CC2541 BLE chip manufactured by Texas Instruments and developers who want to build a similar app that communicates with another BLE device can reference this code.

#Sliding menu on iOS was built using PageMenu (excellent!) repository. Link - https://github.com/PageMenu/PageMenu
